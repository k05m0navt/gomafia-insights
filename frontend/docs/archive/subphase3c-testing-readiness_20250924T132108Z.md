# Archive: Sub-phase 3C â€” Testing & Production Readiness Bootstrap

**Date**: 20250924T132108Z

## Summary
Set up Vitest unit testing, Playwright smoke e2e, CI workflow with preview deployment to Vercel, Prisma generation in CI, and a canary healthcheck. Fixed CI npm prefix issues, added deterministic Playwright fixtures, and wired a telemetry stub.

## Deliverables
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (CI: lint, test, build, publish preview, e2e)
- `frontend/playwright.config.ts` and `frontend/e2e/*` Playwright tests
- `frontend/src/lib/telemetry.ts` (stub)
- `scripts/canary-healthcheck.sh` (synthetic healthcheck)
- `frontend/vitest.config.ts`, `frontend/src/setupTests.ts` test setup
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Results
- Unit tests: PASS
- Build: PASS
- Playwright e2e against preview: smoke tests added (fixture-backed)
- CI workflow updated and pushed to branch `integration/vercel-preview-deploy`.
