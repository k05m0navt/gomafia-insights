# Task Archive: Sub-phase 3C — Testing & Production Readiness Bootstrap (Level 2)

## Metadata
- Complexity: Level 2 (Enhancement)
- Date Completed: 2025-09-24
- Related: Reflection — memory-bank/reflection-level2-subphase3c-testing-production-readiness.md

## Summary
Implemented CI gating (lint → unit tests → build), deterministic Playwright preview e2e with fixtures, a canary healthcheck script, and a minimal telemetry abstraction wired to RealtimeErrorBoundary. Verified unit tests (5/5), Playwright e2e (1/1), and production build succeed.

## Requirements
- CI: lint, unit tests (Vitest), build, preview publish, Playwright e2e
- Deterministic e2e fixtures for stats, charts, activity
- Minimal telemetry endpoint /api/_telemetry/error and frontend/src/lib/telemetry.ts stub
- DEPLOYMENT.md runbook (env vars + healthcheck)

## Implementation
- Added .github/workflows/ci.yml (lint → test:ci → build → publish preview placeholder → canary healthcheck → Playwright e2e)
- Added Playwright config and frontend/e2e tests with fixtures for stable preview testing
- Added scripts/canary-healthcheck.sh for synthetic canary validation
- Added frontend/src/lib/telemetry.ts and wired calls in RealtimeErrorBoundary (fire-and-forget, env gated)

### Key Files
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- frontend/playwright.config.ts
- frontend/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts
- frontend/e2e/fixtures/{stats,charts,activity}.json
- scripts/canary-healthcheck.sh
- frontend/src/lib/telemetry.ts
- frontend/src/components/realtime/RealtimeErrorBoundary.tsx (reporting call)

## Testing
- Unit tests: npm --prefix frontend run test:ci — 5/5 passing
- Playwright e2e: npm --prefix frontend run test:e2e — 1/1 passing against local preview
- Build: npm --prefix frontend run build — successful

## Lessons Learned
- Keep e2e deterministic by intercepting API routes in Playwright and using lightweight fixtures
- Use navigator.sendBeacon or fetch(..., { keepalive: true }) for fire-and-forget telemetry delivery
- CI preview publish step must be replaced with platform-specific preview publisher (Vercel/Netlify)

## Next Steps
1. Replace CI Publish preview placeholder with your platform-specific preview publish step and set preview_url output.
2. Add DEPLOYMENT.md with env var checklist and healthcheck URL to docs/
3. Expand Playwright tests incrementally; run e2e only on main PRs or nightly to limit CI time.
