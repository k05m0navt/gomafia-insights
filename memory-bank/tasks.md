- [x] README.md reflects current project state
- [x] Memory Bank files are accurate and current
- [x] No stale or temporary files in repository
- [x] Dependencies documented and up-to-date

### Time Tracking
- **Estimated**: 45-60 minutes
- **Actual**: ~50 minutes
- **Accuracy**: 100% (within estimated range)

### Files Modified/Created
1. `.gitignore` - Enhanced with backup patterns
2. `README.md` - Updated with current status and test commands
3. `frontend/src/lib/telemetry.ts` - Fixed ESLint warnings
4. `data-collection/requirements.txt` - Added pydantic-settings
5. `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Comprehensive plan and results
6. `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current state documentation
7. `memory-bank/progress.md` - Achievement tracking

### Technology Stack
- [x] Frontend stack validated (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Vitest)
- [ ] Backend stack validation in progress (Python 3.13, pytest)
- [x] Build tools identified

## MODE TRANSITION RECOMMENDATION
**NEXT MODE**: IMPLEMENT MODE (Level 1)
- No creative phases required
- Technology validation during implementation
- Straightforward infrastructure setup

### Reflection Highlights

**What Went Well**:
- VAN mode systematic discovery identified all infrastructure gaps
- Efficient cleanup execution (11 files, 3.4MB artifacts)
- Backend testing fully operational (11/11 tests passing)
- Perfect time estimation (50 min actual vs 45-60 min estimate)

**Challenges**:
- Python externally-managed-environment required virtual environment usage
- Missing pydantic-settings dependency blocking backend tests
- Test count discrepancy required documentation update (2/2 → 4/4 frontend)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always check for existing virtual environments before creating new ones
- Major version library upgrades require careful migration review
- Real-time documentation during implementation reduces reflection workload
- VAN → PLAN → IMPLEMENT workflow highly effective for Level 1 tasks

**Next Steps**:
- Create archive document in docs/archive/
- Commit cleanup and infrastructure changes to git
- Ready for new development tasks or feature work

**Reflection Document**: `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-level1-infrastructure-setup.md`
