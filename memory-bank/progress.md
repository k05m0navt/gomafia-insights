  - **Integration**: Multiple options (local/remote) documented
- [x] Next.js + TypeScript best practices analysis
  - **Stack**: Next.js 14+, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS
  - **Libraries**: Chart.js, Zustand, Zod validation

### Planning Phase - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] Level 3 comprehensive plan creation
- [x] 5-phase implementation strategy
- [x] Component architecture design
- [x] Technology validation checklist
- [x] Creative phase identification

### Technology Choices - VALIDATED ‚úÖ
| Component | Technology | Status | Reasoning |
|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 14+ | ‚úÖ Selected | Requirement + SSR capabilities |
| Language | TypeScript | ‚úÖ Selected | Requirement + type safety |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | ‚úÖ Selected | Utility-first, responsive |
| Charts | Chart.js | ‚úÖ Selected | Proven, TypeScript support |
| State | Zustand | ‚úÖ Selected | Lightweight, TS-friendly |
| Validation | Zod | ‚úÖ Selected | TypeScript-first schemas |
| Documentation | Context7 MCP | ‚úÖ Selected | Requirement + integration ready |

## CURRENT BLOCKERS
- **Creative Phase Required**: Design decisions needed before implementation
- **User Action**: Must type 'CREATIVE' to proceed

## RISK ASSESSMENT
- **Low Risk**: Technology stack well-established and documented
- **Medium Risk**: CORS handling for gomafia.pro data (mitigation: API routes)
- **Low Risk**: Context7 integration (documentation available)

## NOTES
- Planning exceeded expectations with comprehensive analysis
- All Level 3 requirements satisfied per planning guidelines
- Ready to proceed to Creative Mode for design decisions
- Strong foundation established for successful implementation
