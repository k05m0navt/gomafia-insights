# PROGRESS - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## OVERALL PROGRESS
**Project Status**: 25% - Planning Updated (Context7 Removed), Ready for Creative Phase
**Last Updated**: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

## COMPLETED MILESTONES
- [x] Memory Bank directory structure created
- [x] Core Memory Bank files initialized  
- [x] Project complexity assessment (Level 3 confirmed)
- [x] Technology stack research and selection
- [x] Data source analysis (gomafia.pro structure confirmed)
- [x] Implementation planning (5-phase approach)
- [x] Creative phase identification
- [x] Challenge analysis and mitigation planning
- [x] **Plan updated to remove Context7 integration**

## CURRENT MILESTONE
**Level 3 Planning Update - COMPLETED** âœ…
- [x] Requirements updated (Context7 removed)
- [x] Technology stack simplified and validated
- [x] Component architecture updated
- [x] Implementation strategy streamlined (4-5 phases)
- [x] Creative phases identified and flagged
- [x] Dependencies simplified (Context7 removed)
- [x] Challenges updated with mitigation plans
- [x] Technical specifications updated

## PLAN UPDATE DETAILS

### âœ… Successfully Removed
- Context7 MCP server integration
- Context7-related dependencies
- MCP server setup requirements
- Documentation integration complexity
- Context7-specific implementation phases

### âœ… Maintained Core Functionality  
- gomafia.pro data fetching and analytics
- Next.js + TypeScript foundation
- Chart.js visualizations
- Responsive dashboard design
- Performance optimization strategies

### âš¡ Simplified Technology Stack
**Before**: Next.js + TypeScript + Context7 + Tailwind + Chart.js + Zustand
**After**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Chart.js + Zustand

## UPCOMING MILESTONES

### 1. **Creative Phase** (Next - Waiting for User)
   - [ ] UI/UX Design Phase (Dashboard layout, color schemes)
   - [ ] Architecture Design Phase (Data flow, caching strategy)  
   - [ ] Algorithm Design Phase (If custom analytics needed)

### 2. **Implementation Phase** (After Creative)
   - [ ] Technology validation and setup
   - [ ] Data integration implementation
   - [ ] Analytics dashboard development
   - [ ] Testing and deployment

## IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE - UPDATED

### Week 1: Foundation Setup
- [x] **PLAN mode completed and updated**
- [ ] **CREATIVE mode** (User input required)
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project
- [ ] Configure TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Set up project structure

### Week 2: Data Integration
- [ ] Implement gomafia.pro data fetching
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Build validation schemas
- [ ] Implement caching strategy

### Week 3: Analytics Dashboard
- [ ] Build dashboard layout
- [ ] Implement Chart.js visualizations
- [ ] Create ranking components
- [ ] Add filtering functionality

### Week 4-5: Advanced Features & Deployment
- [ ] ELO trend analysis
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Testing and deployment
- [ ] Documentation

## CURRENT BLOCKERS
1. **User Action Required**: Must type 'CREATIVE' to proceed
2. **Creative Phase Dependency**: Cannot begin implementation without design decisions

## RISK MITIGATION - UPDATED
- âœ… **Context7 Complexity Risk**: ELIMINATED with removal
- âœ… **Technology Stack Risk**: REDUCED with simplified stack
- ðŸ”„ **Creative Phase Risk**: PENDING user input to proceed
- ðŸ”„ **Implementation Risk**: PENDING creative phase completion

## NOTES
- Plan successfully updated per user request
- Context7 removal simplifies development timeline
- Core analytics functionality preserved
- Creative phases remain essential for quality implementation
- Ready to proceed once user initiates CREATIVE mode
