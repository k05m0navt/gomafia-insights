# Reflection â€” Phase 4B Sub-phase 3C Testing & Production Readiness Bootstrap

## Summary
Implemented testing baseline, CI, telemetry stub, smoke tests, and deployment checklist to bring dashboard components to production readiness.

## What Went Well
- Added smoke tests for OverviewCards, ChartGrid, RecentActivity; ensured tests pass locally.
- Implemented telemetry stub and a minimal server route  for fire-and-forget client error reporting.
- Created GitHub Actions CI workflow to run lint/tests/build in .
- Fixed ESLint/TS issues encountered during implementation and centralized test mocks in .

## Challenges
- Vitest coverage provider conflicts required removing coverage flag to avoid dependency mismatches.
- Some ESLint rules required temporary suppression in test mocks to keep tests clean and builds passing.

## Lessons Learned
- Centralized mocking in  prevents duplicated test setup and warnings.
- Telemetry should be non-blocking and robust to avoid affecting runtime.

## Improvements / Next Steps
- Add a lightweight e2e smoke test (Playwright) for connected vs disconnected flows.
- Optionally integrate Sentry or similar for production telemetry ingestion.
- Consider adding  to CI as a fatal step after addressing external lib constraints.
