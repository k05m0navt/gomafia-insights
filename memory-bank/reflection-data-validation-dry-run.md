# Reflection â€” Data Validation Dry-Run (Phase B+C)

Date: 2025-08-27

Summary
- Implemented a safe dry-run validation flow for the GoMafia data collector: CLI flags, environment guards, validation reporting, and optional threshold-based acceptance.
- Produced JSON validation reports written to `debug/validation_reports/` without performing DB writes when `--dry-run` is used.

What went well
- Clear separation of concerns: parsing (models), validation (models.ValidationResult), DB upserts (DatabaseService).
- Dry-run safety: added `SKIP_DB_TEST` and `SKIP_DB_WRITE` guards so reports can be generated without altering the DB.
- Usable report output: JSON files created at `debug/validation_reports/<collection>-<timestamp>.json` for audit and review.
- Local runnable flow in an isolated venv (Python 3.11) with dependency installation documented and executed.

Challenges encountered
- pydantic v2 migration (BaseSettings moved to `pydantic-settings`) required compatibility handling in `config.py`.
- Package import layout (running module as script vs package) required making imports resilient and adjusting PYTHONPATH during test runs.
- Supabase client initialization attempted network calls; needed to add short-circuits and skip flags (test/write). Network error logs still appeared until we fully short-circuited write paths.
- Virtualenv files were accidentally tracked; required adding `.venv/` to `.gitignore` and removing cached files from Git.

Lessons learned
- Prefer lazy DB client initialization (defer creating network clients until needed) to avoid side-effects during validation/dry-run.
- Use explicit environment flags for dry-run to ensure all modules behave consistently even during import/init.
- Keep scrapers and models independent: models handle parsing & validation, scrapers only gather raw data.

Actions taken
- Edits made:
  - `data-collection/src/main.py`: CLI flags (`--dry-run`, `--validation-threshold`), dry-run report writer, env guards.
  - `data-collection/src/services/database.py`: SKIP_DB_TEST/SKIP_DB_WRITE guards, short-circuit writes, safer test_connection.
  - Minor collectors/__init__ resiliency edits and model validation threshold wiring.
  - `memory-bank/progress.md`: appended progress entry for the implemented dry-run.
  - `.gitignore`: added `.venv/` and removed tracked venv files from git index.
- Commands run (local): created Python 3.11 venv, installed `data-collection/requirements.txt`, ran dry-run:
  - `PYTHONPATH=data-collection SKIP_DB_TEST=1 SKIP_DB_WRITE=1 .venv/bin/python3.11 -m src.main players --dry-run`
- Validation report path generated during run: `debug/validation_reports/players-20250827T204936.json`

Data quality & verification
- The models provide a `ValidationResult` with explicit `errors`, `warnings`, and `data_quality_score` used for acceptance.
- Current acceptance policy: strict by default (require `validation.is_valid == True`), optional threshold via `--validation-threshold` exposed through `VALIDATION_THRESHOLD` env var.

Improvements to consider
- Defer DB client creation in `DatabaseService.__init__` to avoid any networking at import time.
- Replace placeholder scrapers with real `PlayerScraper` and `TournamentScraper` implementations and re-run validations on real data.
- Add unit tests for `from_scraped_data()` and `validate_data()` for each model class.
- Add CI job for a dry-run validation smoke test to ensure future changes don't break validation/reporting.

Next steps
1. Implement real scrapers and run dry-run on real scraped pages.
2. Add unit/integration tests for validation and reporting.
3. Consider creating a `collection_validations` table for audit logging (optional, behind config flag).
