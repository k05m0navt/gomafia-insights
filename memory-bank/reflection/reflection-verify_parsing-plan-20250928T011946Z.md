# REFLECTION — Verify Parsing PLAN Implementation

Task: Harden `data-collection/src/tools/verify_parsing.py` with JSON-first extraction, whitespace normalization, and robust numeric parsing.
Branch: feature/plan-verify-parsing
Date: 20250928T011946Z

Summary
- Implemented JSON-first extraction (including `__NEXT_DATA__`, LD+JSON, and inline JS assignments), normalization helpers (`normalize_text`, `parse_int_like`, `parse_float_like`), and LD+JSON/unwrapped payload handling.
- Added unit tests and fixtures covering Next data, LD+JSON, NBSP/thin-space number formats, and multilingual labels.

What went well
- Tests: All `data-collection/tests` passed locally in a virtualenv (11 tests).
- Extraction: Structured JSON is used when available; DOM heuristics remain as fallback.
- Numeric parsing now handles `1,250`, `1 250`, `65%`, `0,65`, and normalizes NBSP/thin spaces.
- Added debug-friendly fixture saving on parse failures (existing behavior preserved).

Challenges encountered
- Dependency: pydantic >=2 changed BaseSettings location; needed `pydantic-settings` in the venv to run tests.
- Gitignore: test fixtures were ignored by `.gitignore`; had to force-add them for tests.

Lessons learned
- Favor structured JSON when present — it's far less brittle than DOM regexes.
- Keep parsing helpers centralized to make future fixes easier (e.g., ambiguous separators heuristics).
- Tests and small fixtures speed verification and reduce regressions.

Improvements to consider
- Add an optional `--hydrate` / headless flow for pages requiring client-side JS (opt-in).
- Log ambiguous number parsing cases to aid future tuning.
- Expand fixtures with more real-world variations (languages, separators).

Verification
- Virtualenv: `.venv` created and packages installed from `data-collection/requirements.txt`.
- Unit tests run: `python3 -m unittest discover -s data-collection/tests -p "test_*.py"` → OK (11 tests).

Files changed (in this task)
- Edited: `data-collection/src/tools/verify_parsing.py`
- Added tests: `data-collection/tests/test_parse_utils.py`
- Added fixtures: `data-collection/tests/fixtures/fixture_next_data.html`, `fixture_ldjson.html`
- Memory bank: updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/tasks.md` (status + checklist), added this reflection doc.

Next steps
- When ready, type `ARCHIVE NOW` to archive this task (I will then create an archive doc in `docs/archive/`, update `memory-bank/progress.md`, and reset `activeContext.md`).
