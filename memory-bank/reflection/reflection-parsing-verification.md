# Reflection: Parsing Verification (GoMafia)

Date: 2025-08-28 UTC
Branch: `van/verify-gomafia-parsing-20250828T000000Z`

Summary
- Implemented a non-destructive verification CLI `data-collection/src/tools/verify_parsing.py` to fetch pages or load fixtures, build raw payloads and run model parsers (`from_scraped_data`) and `validate_data()`.
- Created basic parser unit tests and creative-phase doc in memory bank.
- Ran verifier in an isolated venv; confirmed player parsing works for sample `3170` and tournament metadata parses for `470`.

Successes
- Created a safe verification flow that never writes to DB.
- Player model parsed and validated successfully for ID 3170 (warning: win-rate inconsistency flagged).
- Tournament metadata (dates, participants count) parsed from `__NEXT_DATA__` serverData.
- Implemented robust parsing fallbacks: `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON, table HTML extraction, and recursive searches for table-like server structures.

Challenges
- Participant lists for tournaments are delivered client-side (not present in serverData for the pages fetched), so static HTML + `__NEXT_DATA__` lacked players.
- Environment dependency friction: initial system Python (3.7) caused package compatibility issues; required installing Python 3.11, creating a venv, and resolving pydantic v2 migration (`BaseSettings` moved to `pydantic-settings`).
- Serialization issues: Pydantic v2 model `.dict()` deprecation and datetime non-serializable values required a `serialize_model` helper.

Lessons Learned
- Prefer structured server payloads (`__NEXT_DATA__`) when available — far more reliable than ad-hoc HTML scraping.
- Expect client-side APIs or JS-rendered data for participant lists; plan either API discovery or headless rendering.
- Keep verification tooling independent of DB and idempotent for safe iterative testing.

Improvements to make
- Implement automatic participant API discovery (preferred) by scanning network-like endpoints or known AJAX endpoints and calling them.
- If API absent/restricted, implement Selenium render mode to capture the DOM and extract participants.
- Migrate model serialization to `model_dump()` (pydantic v2) consistently and remove deprecated `.dict()` usage.
- Add fixture harvesting: save failing HTML into `data-collection/tests/fixtures/` and add tests for those cases.

Next steps (recommended)
1. Attempt API discovery for participants on gomafia (call pattern detection + test). If found — implement API-based participant fetch and parsing.
2. If API absent/restricted, implement Selenium render mode to capture the DOM and extract participants.
3. Add fixture-based tests using saved participant responses and run them in CI.

Verification Checklist
- Implementation reviewed: YES
- Player parsing verified: YES
- Tournament metadata parsing verified: YES
- Participant list extraction: PARTIAL (client-side; empty with static fetch)
- `verify_parsing.py` created: YES
- tasks.md updated with reflection status: YES
