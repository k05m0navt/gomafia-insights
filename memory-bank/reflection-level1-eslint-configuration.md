# Task Reflection: Level 1 ESLint Configuration Adjustment (Production Readiness)

## Summary
Adjusted ESLint to accommodate Supabase and dynamic UI/data patterns using a 4-tier flat config. Reduced 55+ lint errors to 0 and achieved a clean `next build` with TypeScript checks enabled. Addressed a type-compatibility edge case in `throttle` usage without regressing safety for internal code.

## What Went Well
- Scoped, targeted ESLint overrides avoided broad rule weakening.
- Generated-file ignores eliminated noisy false positives.
- Clean production build with no ESLint errors and fast build time (~2s).
- No functional regressions; dashboard features intact.

## Challenges
- Type generics mismatch surfaced in throttled callback for Supabase payloads.
- Managing strict rules vs. external library `{ [key: string]: any }` constraints.
- Flat config migration nuance (flat `ignores` vs legacy `.eslintignore` warning).

## Lessons Learned
- Prefer flat config `ignores` over legacy `.eslintignore` in Next 15.
- Bind overrides to file globs instead of globally relaxing rules.
- Keep small utility wrappers (e.g., `throttle`) aligned with actual callback types.
- Use underscore naming or rule scoping rather than fighting `no-unused-vars` where data is intentionally optional.

## Process Improvements
- Add build/lint gates to task completion criteria (no “complete” without passing build).
- Run ESLint at milestones (25/50/75/100%) to prevent end-phase cleanup spikes.
- Document exception rationales next to config blocks for future reviewers.

## Technical Improvements
- Gradually replace `any` with `unknown` in internal code where practical.
- Revisit disabled `no-unused-vars` in components and tighten once API stabilizes.
- Address Next.js metadata warnings by migrating to `generateViewport` where applicable.

## Next Steps
- Archive this Level 1 task and update Memory Bank references.
- Optionally pursue a Level 2-3 refactor to formalize types around Supabase adapters.
- Add light tests for realtime subscription and throttling behavior.
