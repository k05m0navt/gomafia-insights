# Task Reflection: Level 2 — Sub-phase 3C Testing & Production Readiness Bootstrap

## Summary
Set up unit testing infrastructure with Vitest + React Testing Library for Next 15/React 19, added jsdom environment and project-wide setup, wrote two smoke tests, and verified tests and production build both pass.

## What Went Well
- Minimal Vitest config with jsdom worked; no Vite plugin required
- Stable smoke tests for `RealtimeErrorBoundary` and `DashboardHeader`
- Mocks avoided animation/toast side effects; tests run fast and deterministically

## Challenges
- Missing `@vitejs/plugin-react` caused initial config load failure
- PostCSS plugin configuration invalid for Next 15 when used as string array
- `vi` globals in setup file caused Next app build type errors

## Lessons Learned
- Keep Vitest config minimal; prefer esbuild JSX automatic over adding Vite plugins
- Next 15 expects PostCSS plugins in object map form (name: options)
- Exclude test-only files from TS app builds to prevent test runner globals leaking

## Process Improvements
- Add “tests must pass and build must succeed” gates to completion criteria
- Standardize test helpers/mocks for UI libraries (framer-motion, lucide, toast)

## Technical Improvements
- Centralize PostCSS config compatible with both Vitest and Next
- Consider adding a lightweight mock for Supabase client to enable deeper realtime tests later

## Next Steps
- Archive this enhancement with links and outcomes
- Plan incremental component test coverage (OverviewCards, RecentActivity)

## Verification
- Tests: 2 passed
- Build: successful
- Files: `frontend/vitest.config.ts`, `frontend/src/setupTests.ts`, two test files under components
