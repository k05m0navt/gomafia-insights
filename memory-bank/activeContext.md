# Active Context

## Current Status
- Status: ACTIVE - In IMPLEMENT mode
- Focus: IMPLEMENT Mode - Apply PLAN changes to `verify_parsing.py`, add tests/fixtures, and validate parsing

## Recently Completed
- Sub-phase 3C — Testing & Production Readiness Bootstrap (archived 20250927T233757Z)
- Parser Verification (archived 2025-09-23)

- Level 1 TypeScript Build Fix (archived) - ✅ A+ Grade
- Production deployment capability fully restored
- Parser Verification (previously archived)

## Current Achievement
- **Build Quality**: ✅ PERFECT - Zero errors, zero warnings
- **Production Status**: ✅ DEPLOYMENT READY
- **Test Coverage**: ✅ 100% passing (5/5 test files)
- **Implementation Excellence**: 100% plan-to-execution fidelity

## Next Steps
- IMPLEMENT Mode: Execute PLAN, add tests and fixtures, run verification locally, then transition to REFLECT
- Next Mode Recommendation: REFLECT (after tests & validation)
