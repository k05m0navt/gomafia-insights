# ACTIVE CONTEXT - CURRENT FOCUS

## CURRENT SESSION
**Date**: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
**Mode**: PLAN (Level 3 Comprehensive Planning)
**Phase**: Planning Complete - Ready for Creative Mode

## IMMEDIATE FOCUS
**Current Task**: Level 3 comprehensive planning completed successfully
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Complete - Awaiting Creative Mode

## PLANNING COMPLETION SUMMARY
**Original Request**: "I would like to create a web app using Next.js with TypeScript that use data from gomafia.pro website and give analytics for the data. use context7"

**Key Research Findings**:
1. **gomafia.pro Data Structure**: Confirmed JSON data available via __NEXT_DATA__ script tag
   - Top players with ELO ratings, tournament stats
   - Top clubs with scores and locations  
   - Tournament and prize information
   - Avatar links and user metadata

2. **Context7 Integration**: MCP server for documentation support
   - Multiple integration options (local/remote)
   - npx-based installation available
   - TypeScript support confirmed

3. **Technology Validation**: Stack selections made and validated
   - Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Chart.js for visualizations
   - Zustand for state management

## CREATIVE PHASES IDENTIFIED

### üé® UI/UX Design Phase (MANDATORY)
**Required For**: Analytics dashboard layout, chart designs, filtering interface
**Key Decisions**: Color schemes, layout hierarchy, user experience flow
**Components**: Dashboard, TopPlayersChart, TopClubsChart, FilterControls

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design Phase (MANDATORY)
**Required For**: Data flow architecture, caching strategy, performance optimization
**Key Decisions**: Update frequency, caching policies, error handling approach
**Components**: DataFetcher, DataCache, APIService, state management

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design Phase (CONDITIONAL)
**Required For**: Custom analytics calculations and statistical analysis
**Key Decisions**: ELO trend calculations, comparative analysis methods
**Components**: Statistical analysis utilities, trend calculation algorithms

## IMPLEMENTATION READINESS
- ‚úÖ Requirements documented and validated
- ‚úÖ Technology stack researched and selected
- ‚úÖ Data source structure analyzed and confirmed
- ‚úÖ Component architecture planned
- ‚úÖ Implementation phases defined
- ‚úÖ Challenges identified with mitigations
- üîÑ **WAITING FOR CREATIVE MODE** to resolve design decisions

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. User types 'CREATIVE' to begin design decision phase
2. Resolve UI/UX design decisions for dashboard
3. Define architecture patterns and data flow
4. Create detailed technical specifications
5. Begin technology validation implementation

## CURRENT BLOCKERS
- **Creative Phase Required**: Cannot proceed to implementation without design decisions
- **User Action Required**: Must type 'CREATIVE' to continue workflow

## NOTES
- Planning phase completed successfully with comprehensive documentation
- All Level 3 requirements satisfied according to planning guidelines
- Creative phases properly identified and flagged
- Technology research completed with Context7 and gomafia.pro validation
