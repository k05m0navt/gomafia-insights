# ACTIVE CONTEXT - CURRENT FOCUS

## CURRENT SESSION
**Date**: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
**Mode**: PLAN (Level 3 Planning - Updated)
**Phase**: Planning Updated - Context7 Removed

## IMMEDIATE FOCUS
**Current Task**: Plan updated to remove Context7 integration per user request
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Plan Updated - Ready for Creative Mode

## PLANNING UPDATE SUMMARY
**Updated Request**: "I would like to create a web app using Next.js with TypeScript that use data from gomafia.pro website and give analytics for the data" (Context7 requirement removed)

**Key Changes Made**:
1. **Context7 Removal**: Eliminated all Context7 MCP integration requirements
2. **Simplified Technology Stack**: Focused on core analytics functionality
3. **Updated Dependencies**: Removed Context7-related dependencies
4. **Streamlined Implementation**: Removed Context7 setup phases

**Maintained Research Findings**:
1. **gomafia.pro Data Structure**: Still confirmed and valid
   - Top players with ELO ratings, tournament stats
   - Top clubs with scores and locations  
   - Tournament and prize information
   - Avatar links and user metadata

2. **Core Technology Validation**: Stack remains solid
   - Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Chart.js for visualizations
   - Zustand for state management

## UPDATED TECHNOLOGY STACK

### Core Technologies (No Changes)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualizations**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Validation**: Zod schemas

### Removed Technologies
- ‚ùå **Context7 MCP**: No longer required
- ‚ùå **MCP Server Setup**: Eliminated
- ‚ùå **Documentation Integration**: Simplified approach

## CREATIVE PHASES IDENTIFIED - UNCHANGED

### üé® UI/UX Design Phase (MANDATORY)
**Required For**: Analytics dashboard layout, chart designs, filtering interface
**Key Decisions**: Color schemes, layout hierarchy, user experience flow
**Components**: Dashboard, TopPlayersChart, TopClubsChart, FilterControls

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design Phase (MANDATORY)
**Required For**: Data flow architecture, caching strategy, performance optimization
**Key Decisions**: Update frequency, caching policies, error handling approach
**Components**: DataFetcher, DataCache, APIService, state management

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design Phase (CONDITIONAL)
**Required For**: Custom analytics calculations and statistical analysis
**Key Decisions**: ELO trend calculations, comparative analysis methods
**Components**: Statistical analysis utilities, trend calculation algorithms

## IMPLEMENTATION READINESS - UPDATED
- ‚úÖ Requirements updated and validated (Context7 removed)
- ‚úÖ Technology stack simplified and confirmed
- ‚úÖ Data source structure analyzed and confirmed
- ‚úÖ Component architecture updated
- ‚úÖ Implementation phases streamlined
- ‚úÖ Challenges updated with Context7 removal
- üîÑ **WAITING FOR CREATIVE MODE** to resolve design decisions

## COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT UPDATE
**Level**: Still Level 3 (Complex System)
**Reasoning**: While Context7 removal simplifies the stack, the core complexity remains:
- External data integration
- Analytics dashboard development
- Performance optimization
- Multiple creative phases

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. User types 'CREATIVE' to begin design decision phase
2. Resolve UI/UX design decisions for dashboard
3. Define architecture patterns and data flow
4. Create detailed technical specifications
5. Begin technology validation implementation

## CURRENT BLOCKERS
- **Creative Phase Required**: Cannot proceed to implementation without design decisions
- **User Action Required**: Must type 'CREATIVE' to continue workflow

## NOTES
- ‚úÖ Context7 successfully removed from all documentation
- ‚úÖ Technology stack simplified but maintains core functionality
- ‚úÖ Creative phases remain the same as they focus on analytics design
- ‚úÖ Implementation timeline slightly improved with Context7 removal
