# Archive: Phase 4B â€” Sub-phase 4 Global Realtime UX Integration (Level 2)

## Overview
- Date: 2025-08-12
- Level: 2 (Enhancement)
- Scope: Global realtime UX integration with lazy Supabase, guarded store, and client bootstrap

## Objectives
- Visible connection status and controls across the app
- Safe auto-connect without build-time env failures
- Preserve clean tests and production build

## Implementation Summary
- Lazy client via `getSupabase()` and guarded helpers
- Store updated to use `getSupabase()` in `connect/subscribe/unsubscribe*`
- Client-only `RealtimeBootstrap` for auto-connect; injected in `app/layout.tsx`
- `'use client'` enforced on realtime hooks

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` (lazy client + guards)
- `frontend/src/lib/realtime.ts` (guarded usage)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useRealtime.ts` (client directive)
- `frontend/src/components/providers/RealtimeBootstrap.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` (bootstrap injection)

## Validation Results
- Tests: PASS (2/2)
- Build: PASS (clean)

## Reflection
See `memory-bank/reflection-level2-subphase4-global-realtime-ux-integration.md` for full reflection including WWW, challenges, solutions, and lessons.

## Business Value
- Stability: Prevents runtime/env-related crashes
- UX: Clear visibility/control of realtime connection
- Maintainability: Standardized lazy-client pattern for SDKs

## Next Steps
- Potential Storybook/visual test for status indicator
- Address Next 15 metadata warnings via `generateViewport`
