# Archive: Parsing Verification â€” GoMafia

Date: 2025-09-23 UTC
Branch: "$BRANCH"

Summary
- Purpose: Final archive of the Parser Verification task to record implementation, migration to Pydantic v2, parsing improvements, tests and next steps.

What I changed
- Hardened parsing heuristics in `data-collection/src/tools/verify_parsing.py`:
  - Expanded JSON extraction (LD+JSON, application/json, `__NEXT_DATA__`, inline JS-assigned objects like `window.__INITIAL_*`).
  - Improved numeric normalization and added `_clean_numeric_text` to handle NBSP and thin-space separators.
  - Enhanced regexes for ELO, games played/won, and win rate with multilingual labels and thousands separators.
- Migrated Pydantic usages:
  - Converted `@validator` usages to Pydantic v2 `@field_validator` where appropriate.
  - Replaced class-based `Config` blocks with `model_config = ConfigDict(...)` across configs/models to remove deprecation warnings.
- Tests & fixtures:
  - Added fixtures and unit tests for exotic number formats and label variants under `data-collection/tests/`.
  - Added `data-collection/HEADLESS.md` documenting optional Playwright headless fetch for JS-rendered pages.

Verification
- Test suite: 7 passed locally after fixes.
- Lint/format: `black` applied and flake8 issues addressed for edited files.
- Reflection: see `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-parsing-verification.md` for earlier notes and the 2025-09-23 update.

Files changed (high level)
- data-collection/src/tools/verify_parsing.py
- data-collection/src/models/*.py (migrations to field_validator / ConfigDict)
- data-collection/src/config.py (ConfigDict)
- data-collection/tests/* (new fixtures & tests)
- data-collection/HEADLESS.md
- memory-bank/reflection/reflection-parsing-verification.md (updated)

Next recommended steps
1. Implement API discovery for tournament participant lists (preferred).  If API discovery fails:
2. Add an optional Playwright-based `--render` mode to `verify_parsing.py` for JS-rendered participant lists.
3. Harvest failing pages into `data-collection/tests/fixtures/` and add deterministic unit tests for them.
